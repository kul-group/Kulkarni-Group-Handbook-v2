### Workstation and Paperwork

#### Workstation

1.	If you are a Ph.D. student, ask Ambar to request keys for your office and for Bainer hall, pick them up in Ghausi. 
2.	Talk to Ambar about getting a monitor, keyboard, mouse and adapter and set them up at your desk. Make sure you are comfortable. And make sure to thank IT for helping transport stuff to your desk!

#### Paperwork

- Make sure to sign your TA or GSR appointment paperwork (which gets sent to you near the beginning of each quarter of the school year)
