Meeting schedule updated quarterly. View updated schedule [here](https://kulkarni.sf.ucdavis.edu/resources/group-meetings).

Research Meetings (once/week): These consist of 2 parts: 
    1. a 'Research Talk' which is about 20 minutes long and intended to mimic a conference presentation, giving a detailed review of a student's work
    2. a 'Literature Deep-Dive' which is a 20 minute review of the literature around a research topic related to a student's work

Journal Club (once/week): The listed lab member leads a discussion of a paper, other students are tasked with explaining a figure from the paper. The week's paper and figure assignments are typically announced 3 days before the meeting on Slack.

Supergroup Meetings: These are combined Experimental-Theory group meetings with other research groups on campus, typically every 2 weeks. Updates about this will be posted on Slack.
