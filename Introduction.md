#### Welcome To the Group!

Welcome to the Kulkarni Group! We look forward to working with you. For any questions, you can email Professor Kulkarni (arkulkarni@ucdavis.edu) or reach out to people in the [Contact List](Contact_List.md).

#### How To Use This Guide

This guide was written to meet three goals. First, to help new students get started in the lab. These students will find the [Student Startup](README.md#student-startup) section of the guide most helpful. Second, to enable more established students to learn the backround of our research as well as learn new techniques. These students will find the [How-To Section](README.md#how-to-guides) most useful. Third, this guide functions as a centralized source of information and experience which lab members can reference throughout their studies. The [Further Resorces Section](README.md#further-resources) includes tips and tricks which other students have found useful, suggestions for troubleshooting problems, contact list, and meeting schedule.

#### Do I have to follow all of the advice?

This guide is simply advice backed by the experience of the group. Oftentimes, following this advice takes more work at the beginning, but pays off in the long term. You should at least *try* to follow these guidelines and see how they work for you. However, we understand that everyone has different ways of doing things and you should do what is best for you. 

*Note: this guide was inspired by the [group handbook](https://hackingmaterials.lbl.gov/handbook.pdf) made for the Jain group at LBNL. Though the tools we use are different, it contains a lot of useful advice and can serve as a supplement to this guide.*
