## Classes to Take

Here is a list of classes students in the group have found interesting or useful. 
Note: 
- Some specialized classes aren't offered every year
- Some classes are much harder than others, you can check 
that your courseload is manageable by messaging the group on slack


#### Fall
-	CHE 155 Computer Methods in Chemistry
-	CHE 204 Math Methods in Chemistry
-	MAT 167 Applied Linear Algebra (Note: focus on theory)
-	CHE 210C Quantum Chemistry
- STA 206 Regression Analysis I
- ECS 230: Applied Numerical Linear Algebra (Note: focus on computing)
- PHY 240A: Condensed Matter
- CHE 226: Transition Metal Chemistry

#### Winter
- STA 135 Multivariable Data Analysis
- STA 207 Regression Analysis II
- CHE 215 Theoretical and Computational Chemistry
- CHE 210A Quantum Chemistry
- CHE 211B Statistical Mechanics
- ECH 261 (Taught by Professor Faller)
- STA 220 Data Analysis and Web Technologies
- PHY 240B: Condensed Matter

#### Spring
- ECS 171/271 Machine Learning (Note: ECS 171 is currectly only available for undergrads, so pick 271 if you want)
- EMS 298: Intro To Materials Simulation (Taught by Professor Mason)
- CHE 210B Quantum Chemistry
- STA 208: Statistical Machine Learning (Note: focus on both theory and application)
- STA 243: Computational Statistics (Note: useful but R is the only language)
- STA 221: High Performance Statistical Computing
- ECS 032B: Object Oriented Programming (Note: you would not recieve credit for this course as a graduate student)
- PHY 240C: Condensed Matter

Add ECH/EMS 290 and 299 with Ambar to receive credit for lab work and group meeting (in addition to 290 lecture series, if required). Make sure you are meeting your department specific course requirements as well.
